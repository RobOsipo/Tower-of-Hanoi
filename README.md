## How to play
The goal of the puzzle is to move all the disks on the starting rod to the final rod, while taking care to only move one disk at a time and never placing a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
To interact with the puzzle as it appears, click within the space of the rod (disk-container) that has the disk you would like to move, and then click within the space of the rod (disk-container) you would like to move it to.

Each time you do this, your move will be counted, and you can compare the number of moves you have made to the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle, the goal.

Above the puzzle/game container is a submission box where you can specify the number of disks you would like to play the puzzle with, as well as a button you can click at any time to restart with the same number of disks.
